## Housekeeping

`ktkit` includes a copy of `ncbiTaxonomyTree.py` as downloaded from [https://github.com/mbrockman1/NCBI_taxonomy_tree](https://github.com/mbrockman1/NCBI_taxonomy_tree), a Python3 port of the original script from [https://github.com/frallain/NCBI_taxonomy_tree](https://github.com/frallain/NCBI_taxonomy_tree). I've used this because everything else is a pain in the arse to install. Deal with it.
